******How is React treated as a dependency, even though it's a library?
    In earlier examples, we used CDN links to include React in our projects. However, relying on CDNs is not ideal because it can result in costly network operations.

    To solve this, we can install React directly into our project using npm.
    
    npm (Node Package Manager) is a tool for managing dependencies in a project. Once React is installed via npm, it becomes a dependency of your project. This approach is more efficient as it avoids unnecessary network requests and ensures React is readily available within the project.



                so "npm install react " and "npm insatll react-dom"
    


*****how to bring it into your index.js:

                import React from "react";
                import React-Dom from "react-dom"
