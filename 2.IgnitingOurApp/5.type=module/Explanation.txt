*****Browsers always expect plain JavaScript, which means JavaScript without ES6+ features like import/export. 
Let’s understand this with a scenario:
    
    Scenario: Using React with NPM
        1.What happens when you install React and ReactDOM?

            -->If you install React and ReactDOM using NPM, they are stored in the node_modules folder.
            
            -->To use them in your project, you need to import them into your app.js file:
        
                        import React from "react";
                        import ReactDOM from "react-dom";


        2.How does the browser react to this?

            *If you reference "app.js" in your "index.html" like this:
       
                                <script src="app.js"></script>

                    *The browser will throw an error:
                        -->Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.

                        -->This happens because browsers cannot understand ES6+ syntax like import or export in regular scripts.



**Q.Why does this happen?
        *When you run npx parcel index.html, Parcel processes your files and hosts the output files (index.html, app.js, etc.) on a local development server.
        
        *However, Parcel will only transpile your source files (convert ES6+ code into plain browser-compatible JavaScript) if it knows the file needs processing.
                            
                            **Parcel Transpilation Behavior:
                                    Parcel will transpile your source files into browser-understandable code (like ES5) only if:

                                        1.It knows that the file needs processing.
                                            For example, when you use import/export syntax, Parcel assumes the file is a module and should be transpiled.
                                    
                                    2.The file is part of the build pipeline.
                                            If the file is referenced in an HTML <script> tag without type="module", Parcel won't process it as a module. Instead, it will serve the file as-is to the browser.
                                            
                                            This can lead to errors if the file contains ES6+ syntax, as most browsers can't handle import/export in plain <script> tags.

 
        *In this case, you used a regular <script> tag, and Parcel served the raw app.js without transpiling it.
        
        *As a result, the browser tries to interpret the raw ES6+ code (with import/export) and throws an error because it doesn’t understand it.









Solution: Use type="module:
To fix this, you need to tell Parcel to transpile your app.js by specifying it as a module in your HTML:

                        <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>


        *Adding type="module" tells both the browser and Parcel that app.js is a JavaScript module.

        *Parcel will then:
                    1.Transpile the ES6+ code (like import/export) into plain browser-compatible JavaScript.
                    
                    2.Host the transpiled files on the local development server.

        *Now, when the browser fetches the processed app.js, it can understand the code without any issues.











Improved Use Case
    1.You have an app.js that uses ES6 imports to bring in React and ReactDOM:
    
                    import React from "react";

                    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

                    const element = React.createElement("h1", null, "Hello, React!");

                    ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById("root"));



    2.You include app.js in your index.html:
   
                    <div id="root"></div>

                    <script type="module" src="app.js"></script>

    3.Run npx parcel index.html.
                Parcel transpiles app.js into plain JavaScript and serves it on a local development server.

                The browser fetches and runs the transpiled app.js without issues.











Key Takeaways
    *Browsers cannot understand ES6 imports/exports in regular scripts.

    Parcel will transpile your files only if they are marked as modules.

    Use type="module" to ensure Parcel processes and transpiles the code properly, so the browser gets a plain JavaScript version it can understand.
