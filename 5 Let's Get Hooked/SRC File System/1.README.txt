Before we get into Hooks , Lets know about the How to Maintain the File System for a Project (you can Maintain the FS like you want , this is organzing and structuring)


Know more about FS: go to : https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html


1. All the Source code is kept is "src" folder -------> why? there is no specific reason for that , its because of this is a good Industry Practice.

*2.People use to name componenets with ".js" and ".jxs" , both are same. some may use TypeScript and name as ".tsx". Allare ".js" only 

3. ALL the componenets are Kept in "componenets" Folder, and  Seperate Folder is Maintaintaied for Each componenet and it Impoted/Exported to render it .( build tool will collect them and will build the APP)
    
    There are two types of import and Export:

        1.Defult import and export : with default export you can export only one and import only one.
                Ex: export default Body 
                    import SwiggyDataList from "../utils/mockData"

                *if you try two default exports in a single file it wil throw error


        2.Named import and export : this is can be used when In a single file you have import and export Multiple things.

       ---->       For Export: mention "export" keyword infornt what ever you want. 
                                Ex: 
                                    export const logo_url ="https://.....";
                                    export const CDN_URL ="https://.....";
                                    
                                    ****even for componenets : export const Header =()=> {...}
                                        you can use both default export and named export on single componenet.

                                                         Ex:       import { LOGO_URL } from "../utils/constants"

                                                                        export const Header =()=> {
                                                                            return (
                                                                                <div className="header">
                                                                                    <div className="logo-container">
                                                                                    <img 
                                                                                        className="logo"
                                                                                        src={LOGO_URL} alt="logo" />
                                                                                    </div>
                                                                                    <div className="nav-items">
                                                                                        <ul>
                                                                                            <li>Home</li>
                                                                                            <li>About</li>
                                                                                            <li>contact</li>
                                                                                            <li>cart</li>
                                                                                        </ul>
                                                                                    </div>
                                                                                </div>
                                                                            )
                                                                        }
                                                                        export default Header


                        *Q.Is this both defalt export and named export will possible to constants also?
                            Yes, it is possible to use both default export and named export in a constants file. This approach is often used when you want to export a primary constant or an object as the default export while also providing additional specific constants as named exports.

                           Ex:     
                                // Named exports
                                export const SWIGGY_CDN_IMAGE_URL = "https://media-assets.swiggy.com/swiggy/image/upload/fl_lossy,f_auto,q_auto,w_660";
                                export const LOGO_URL = "https://example.com/logo.png";

                                // Default export
                                const DEFAULT_CONSTANTS = {
                                SWIGGY_CDN_IMAGE_URL,
                                LOGO_URL,
                                };

                                export default DEFAULT_CONSTANTS;

                            

                        import DEFAULT_CONSTANTS, { SWIGGY_CDN_IMAGE_URL } from "./constants";

                        console.log(DEFAULT_CONSTANTS.LOGO_URL); // Access via default
                        console.log(SWIGGY_CDN_IMAGE_URL);       // Access named export






        ------>    For Import: use curly braces( { } ) . 

                                Ex:  import {CDN_URL,logo_ur} from "../../XXX"                      // . refers to the current directory.
                                                                                                        .. refers to the parent directory (one level up).


                                **import Header, { LOGO_URL } from "./Header";
                                    "The statement import Header, { LOGO_URL } from "./Header"; works because the Header.js file is combining default export and named export. While LOGO_URL originates from the constants.js file, it can still be re-exported by Header.js. This allows other files to import LOGO_URL from Header.js."

 



     i.Export-------------------->Do this before you Import the componenet-----> "First Give then Take"
        After keeping the componenet in Seperate file use "export default Header(name of the componenet)" or "" to Export the componenet. 
    
    ii.Import
            After the Export , Import like this "import Header(name of the componenet) from "/.componenets/Header(PATH of the componenet)" -->   (/.componenets/Header or /.componenets/Header.js or /.componenets/Header.jsx  ALL are same )

4. If you have any Hard coded Data(like constants, footer component ,Big strings ,links.. ) Never keep that in any component file. Please  keep a seperate folder and a Seperate file it like "utils.js" or "constants.js" ....
