"The useRouteError hook is a feature provided by React Router that allows you to handle and display errors that occur during navigation or data loading in your app. It retrieves the error object associated with a specific route, making it easy to display meaningful error messages."








Key Features of useRouteError:
                                It is designed to be used in an Error Boundary Route (a route that catches and handles errors).
                                
                                It retrieves the error object thrown during:

When Should You Use useRouteError?
            You should use useRouteError when you want to:

                                                            1.Handle Errors Gracefully: Display custom error messages for specific routes or during navigation failures.
                                                            
                                                            2.Differentiate Errors: Provide detailed feedback about the cause of the error (e.g., network issues, invalid data, or unauthorized access).
