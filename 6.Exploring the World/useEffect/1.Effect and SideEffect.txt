            Statement : "The side effects of taking the corona vaccine are body pains."


        1. What is the "effect"?
            The effect is the primary, intended outcome of taking the vaccine.

                Effect: Developing immunity against the coronavirus.


            It is called an effect because:
                It is the direct and expected result of taking the vaccine.
                
                It is the main purpose of the action (taking the vaccine).
        


        2. What is the "side effect"?
            The side effect is any unintended consequence that happens alongside the primary effect.

                Side effect: Body pains.

            It is called a side effect because:
                    It is not the main goal of taking the vaccine.
                    
                    It is an additional, indirect outcome that occurs due to the vaccine's interaction with the body.
