the restuarnt menu card that we have is handling two tasks:
        1. it feches the data from the api
        2. it displays the data 


Don't you think that it is doing overwork ?

Acc to the SRM principle a Compoent or a task should have only one Responsibility.

so we have to handle the data fetching in one component and displaying it in another component 

so how to do that ? 
    
 with help of cutom hooks we can keep two functionoloties in two diffrent components
