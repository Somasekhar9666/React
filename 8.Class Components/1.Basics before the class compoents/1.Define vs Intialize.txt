Initialize:
            Meaning: "Assigning an Initial value" to a variable or object when it is created.
            
            Focus: It’s about starting something with an initial value.
            
            Example in Code:
                            let x = 10; // Initialize x with the value 10



Define:
        Meaning: Declaring a variable, object, function, or class, i.e., specifying its existence.
        
        Focus: It’s about creating or declaring something but not necessarily giving it a value.
        
        Example in Code:
                        let y; // Define y (but it has no value yet, so it's undefined)




Key Differences:
               	                                    Define	                                                Initialize
                
                Action	                 Declaring the existence of something.	                    Assigning an initial value during creation.
                
                Value	                 No value is necessarily assigned.	                        A specific value is provided immediately.
                  
                Purpose	                 To create a placeholder for later use.	                    To set a starting value.







Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you are preparing a workspace:

                                    1.Define:
                                            You set up a desk in the workspace with no tools or items on it.
                                            
                                            The desk exists but isn’t ready for work—it’s just a blank slate.
                                            
                                            Example:
                                                    let workspace; // Define the workspace (it's empty)
                                    
                                    
                                    2.Initialize:
                                                You put specific tools (pen, paper, and laptop) on the desk so you can start working right away.
                                                
                                                The workspace is now ready to be used.
                                                
                                                Example:
                                                        let workspace = "desk with tools"; // Initialize workspace with tools






Code Comparison
                Defining without Initializing:
                                            let name; // Defined, but not initialized
                                            console.log(name); // undefined
                
                Defining and Initializing:
                                        let name = "Madara"; // Defined and initialized
                                        console.log(name); // Madara








When to Use Which?
                Define: Use when you want to create a placeholder but may assign the value later.

                Initialize: Use when you already know the starting value at the time of creation.

    This distinction is crucial for efficient memory and logic management in programming.
