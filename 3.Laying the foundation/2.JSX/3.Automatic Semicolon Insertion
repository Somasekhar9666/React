JavaScript Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)
        JavaScript has a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) that adds semicolons in certain places where it thinks they are missing. This behavior can cause issues when writing multi-line JSX without parentheses.





Ex:
Without parentheses:
            (jsx)
                const heading2 = 
                <h1 className="ss" tabIndex={5}>
                hello
                </h1>;

        Here, JavaScript may treat the <h1> tag as a separate expression, causing a syntax error.



    So ASI would insert a semicolon after const heading2 =, thinking that the assignment is complete, leaving the JSX code as a separate statement. This would cause a syntax error, as the JSX is not assigned to anything (since the semicolon was inserted after the const heading2 = line).
            
            It would effectively be like this:

                        const heading2 = ;    // ASI inserts semicolon here, thinking it's done with the assignment
                        <h1 className="ss" tabIndex={5}>   // This becomes a separate expression, causing an error.
                        hello
                        </h1>;
            
                This leads to a syntax error because you can’t just place JSX on its own without assigning it to a variable or expression.
    

    *How Parentheses Prevent ASI Issues:

            By wrapping the JSX code in parentheses, you are clearly indicating that the JSX block is a single expression. This prevents ASI from incorrectly inserting a semicolon and ensures that the entire block is treated as part of the assignment.

                    const heading2 = (
                    <h1 className="ss" tabIndex={5}>
                        hello
                    </h1>
                    );

                 Now, the semicolon is properly placed at the end of the assignment, and JavaScript understands that the JSX expression is a single statement assigned to heading2.






     Single-Line JSX
        For single-line JSX, parentheses are not required because there’s no ambiguity, and ASI doesn’t interfere.

        Example:
                return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
                
        Since the JSX is on the same line as the return statement, JavaScript does not mistakenly insert a semicolon, so the code works as expected.






wiht html :

    <h1 class="container highlight" class="container highlight" >Hello World</h1>;

with JSX:

    const Heading = <h1 class="container highlight" class="container highlight" >Hello World</h1>;
    root.render(Heading)


same JSX , when the JSX
