JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data format(structure) used for storing and exchanging data between a server and a client. It is easy to read and write for humans and easy to parse and generate for machines.


Key Characteristics:
        Text-based format
        
        Derived from JavaScript but is language-independent
        
        Represents data as key-value pairs


What is a JSON Structure?
        A JSON structure is composed of the following basic elements:

                1.Objects:
                    Represented by {} (curly braces).
                    
                    Contain key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values can be any valid JSON type.
                

                    Ex: {
                        "name": "Alice",
                        "age": 25
                        }
                

                2.Arrays:
                        Represented by [] (square brackets).
                        
                        Contain a list of values, separated by commas.

                    Ex:

                        {
                        "names": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
                            }
                


                3.Values:

                    Can be:
                        Strings (enclosed in quotes)
                        
                        Numbers
                        
                        Booleans (true or false)
                        
                        null
                        
                        Another object or array
                    
                    Ex:

                        {
                        "status": true,
                        "count": 10,
                        "meta": null
                        }


Q.What Was Used Before JSON?
            XML (Extensible Markup Language):

                    XML was widely used before JSON for data exchange.
                    
                    Example of XML:
                    
                            <person>
                            <name>Alice</name>
                            <age>25</age>
                            </person>
                

        Problems with XML:

            Verbose and harder to read
            
            Requires closing tags
            
            More complex to parse compared to JSON




Q.What Problem Does JSON Solve?
        Simplicity:
            JSON is much simpler and more lightweight compared to XML.
            
            Easy to read for humans and easy to parse by machines.
        
        Interoperability:
            JSON is language-independent, making it a universal data format for APIs and web applications.
        
        Speed:
            JSON parsing is faster than XML parsing in most cases.
        
        Readability:
            JSON's structure is straightforward, making it easier for developers to understand.



Q.What Does JSON Contain?
        Key-Value Pairs:
            Keys must be strings.
            
            Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or null.
        
        
        Nested Structures:
            JSON can contain objects within objects or arrays within arrays.
