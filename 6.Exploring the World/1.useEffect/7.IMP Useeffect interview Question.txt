                    or 

    Why is useEffect called after the empty component is rendered? Why isn't useEffect executed beforehand? This makes me render fake cards until it is called."


        Ans: 
            "useEffect is used to handle side effects like fetching data or setting up subscriptions, while the main effect is rendering the UI. It doesnâ€™t block the initial rendering of the component. Once rendering is complete, React allows the side effects to execute, such as making a fetch call."
