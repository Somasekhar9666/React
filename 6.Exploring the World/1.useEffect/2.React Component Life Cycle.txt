"React component lifecycle" refers to the sequence of stages that a "React Component" goes through during its existence in an application, including when it is created, updated, and removed from the UI( removed from the DOM).

The Stages are : 

    1. Mounting Stage (Component is Created and Added to the DOM)

            What Happens:
                        The component is initialized and inserted into the DOM.
                        
                        This is the phase where you fetch initial data or set up necessary subscriptions.
    


    2. Updating Stage (Component Re-Renders Due to State/Props Changes)
        
            What Happens:
                        The component updates whenever its state or props change.

                        This is the phase where you might perform actions based on updated data.



    3. Unmounting Stage (Component is Removed from the DOM)

            What Happens:
                        The component is removed from the DOM.

                        This is where you clean up resources like event listeners, timers, or subscriptions to avoid memory leaks.
