In JavaScript, expression body and block body refer to the way the body of an arrow function is defined. These terms help distinguish between concise single-expression arrow functions and more detailed multi-statement arrow functions.





**Q.why the first one  fails  , but why the second works fine.
1. const Heading = () => { 
  <h1 className="h1" tabIndex="5">
    this heading is made of simple JSX
  </h1>
};

2.const Heading = () => ( 
  <h1 className="h1" tabIndex="5">
    this heading is made of simple JSX
  </h1>
);


Ans:
const Heading = () => { 
  <h1 className="h1" tabIndex="5">
    this heading is made of simple JSX
  </h1>
};
    In this version, you are using a block body for the function (i.e., curly braces {}). In a block body, you need to explicitly use the return statement to return JSX. Without it, the function will not return anything, which causes the failure.





const Heading = () => ( 
  <h1 className="h1" tabIndex="5">
    this heading is made of simple JSX
  </h1>
);


In this example, the arrow function uses implicit return. This means that the expression inside the parentheses () is automatically returned. You don't need the return keyword, as JSX is returned directly.










Q.will this also comes under exprresion body , i has not a single line logic , why the return is not required here?
            const Heading = () => ( 
            <h1 className="h1" tabIndex="5">
                this heading is made of simple JSX
            </h1>
            ); 



*An expression body in an arrow function means the function contains a single expression that is implicitly returned. The expression can span multiple lines, as long as it's wrapped in parentheses ().

In your example:

                const Heading = () => (
                <h1 className="h1" tabIndex="5">
                    this heading is made of simple JSX
                </h1>
                );

        The JSX is a single expression (even though it looks like multiple lines due to formatting).
        
        It's enclosed in parentheses (), which is syntactic sugar for multi-line expressions.
        
        React treats the JSX as an expression that evaluates to a React element.
    
    
    Thus, no return is needed because the JSX is implicitly returned.





Key Takeaways:
    *Arrow function with expression body: Implicit return (no need to use return).

    *Arrow function with block body (curly braces): Explicit return (need to use return).
    
    *Regular function: Always needs return when using block body.
